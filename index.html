            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, 
            pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, 
            bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, 
            the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. 
            The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs 
            (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). 
            Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their 
            beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. 
            Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. 
            A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, 
            giving the appearance of a beard.Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, 
            with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S
            are Cornish and White Rock.Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. 
            In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, 
            are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered 
            with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the 
            flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens 
            and promote growth.
